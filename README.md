# wcl-test-examples
Unit testing, Automated tests, Integration tests, TDD and BDD are essential things to know about for testers.

The aim of this project is to provide examples of test related concepts and libraries in the Java eco-system.

## Unit Testing

The aim of unit testing is to provide specific testing of components of a system at the lowest possible level, for 
example testing methods in a Java class in perfect isolation; any dependencies removed from the equation via mocks, 
stubs etc to ensure that only method functionality is exercised by tests.  

## API Testing

The aim of API testing is to ensure application programming interfaces do what they say on the tin, reliabilty and 
performance, often forming integration tests.

## Web testing

The aim of web testing is to check clients - UI elements, integration with API services et al.

### Selenium

Tests using the Selsnium framework, exploring concepts.
